# spheuchyp

## Intro

spheuchyp is a series of apps investigating [Coxeter Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group) and tesselations in spherical, euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. It also supports rectified and truncated polyhedrons ([truncation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry))/[rectified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_(geometry))).

It uses [three.js](https://threejs.org) to support 3d graphics and interactivity as well as some jquery to keep it neat.

If you can't access these apps checkout https://calummccain.github.io which *should* be more or less up-to-date  :)
