            <h1>How to tesselate \(\mathbb{H}^3\)</h1>

            

            <p>In order two tesselate \(\mathbb{H}^3\) we need to calculate two things:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>What cell we're tesselating</li>
                <li>How many of them fit around each edge</li>
                <li>The size of the cells</li>
                <li>The reflection matrices corresponding to the tesselation</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Cell size is important because Hyperbolic spaces are fundamentally different to the usual Euclidean
                space
                that
                we are used to. Essentially angles and lengths are much more dependent on each other; knowing the
                angles
                gives
                you the lengths and knowing the lengths gives you the angles. These relations are encapsulated in
                the
                hyperbolic trig formulae (link) where you can find more info on why theres a difference.
            </p>

            <p>
                The method we are using to calculate the vertices of our tessellation revolves around the fact that
                hyperbolic
                tessellation’s (and other tessellation’s in general) have a Coxeter group attached to them (link).
                These
                groups
                have ‘nice’ geometric interpretations and their generators (link) can be explicitly calculated in
                terms of
                matrices. With these matrices, which end up being reflections, we can take one of our cells and
                reflect it
                to
                fill up our space.
            </p>

            <p>
                Probably the best way to follow this recipe is to use an example and the arguably simplest one to
                look at is
                the
                order 5 cubic honeycomb with the Schläfi symbol \(\left\{4, 3, 5 \right\}\) (link). This is the
                analogue of
                the
                usual way that
                you’d pack cubes in a box - a bit like Tetris or boring lego, but instead of having 4 cubes around
                each
                edge, we
                have 5. This is where our intuition breaks down a little as it’s quite clear that this isn’t
                possible not
                but in
                Hyperbolic space we have more freedom with the angles so we should be ok.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                The first step is to construct our fundamental tetrahedron (link). We are going to use a cell
                centred model
                (the
                tessellation is symmetric about our origin \( \left(1, 0, 0, 0 \right)\) and there is a cell that
                has the
                origin
                as it’s centre.
                It’s worth mentioning that we are going to be using the hyperboloid model (link) as it has a nice
                quadratic
                form
                - useful for later, and <a href="geodesic.html">geodesics</a> are easier to calculate. We can also
                use some
                little hacks because we
                are using cubes, such as the coordinates of the vertices, edges and faces are easier to calculate.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to make some progress we need to know some of the angles in the tetrahedron. It turns out
                that 4 of
                the
                12 are actually right angles. This can be seen by either the fact that it looks right or more
                scientifically
                you
                can use the Coxeter diagram of the group:
            </p>

            <p>
                4---3---5
                V E F C
            </p>

            <p>
                This says that the angles between the V F planes, V C planes and E C planes are all \(\pi/2\); the
                angle
                between the VE planes is \(\pi/4\); the angle between the EF planes is \(\pi/3\) and the angle
                between the
                FC
                planes is
                \(\pi/5\). The best way to represent this is by drawing a net of the tetrahedron. It’s worth
                mentioning that
                the
                triangles are hyperbolic and so the angles don’t have to add up to pi.
            </p>

            <p>
                ****** image of net of fundamental domain *******
            </p>

            <p>
                We actually need one more angle however - FCE. We can’t directly read it from the coxeter diagram so
                we will
                use
                a bit of geometry. In the Poincare model (link) of hyperbolic space the central cube is going to be
                a
                ‘scaled
                down’ version of the usual Euclidean cube. I’ve put scaled in inverted commas as it’s not all scaled
                down
                by.
                The same amount but long story short, we can let C prop (0, 0, 0), F prop (1, 0, 0), E prop (1, 1,
                0), V
                prop
                (1, 1, 1). Using the standard euclidean inner product we find FCE is \(\pi/4\).
            </p>

            <p>
                We have now all the angles that we need to calculate the hyperbolic distances between the points of
                our
                fundamental tetrahedron. Given all the right angles we are going to make use of the hyperbolic
                right-angled
                triangle formulas (link)
            </p>

            <p>\[\cosh(c) = \cosh(a) \cosh(b) = \cot(A) \cot(B)\]</p>

            <p>
                From this we find:
            </p>

            <p>\[\cosh(CE) = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)cot\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) =
                \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                From this we can actually work out the coordinates of E in the hyperboloid model. Remember C(1, 0,
                0, 0) and
                cosh(CE) =
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore \(E \left( \cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right), \frac{\sqrt{\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5}
                \right)^2 -
                1}}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{\sqrt{\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 - 1}}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 \right)\)
            </p>

            <p>
                We have that the midpoint of the hyperbolic line between \(A\) and \(B\) is:
            </p>

            <p>\[\frac{A + B}{2\cosh\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)}\]</p>

            <p>
                E is situated between \((a, b, b, b)\) and \((a, b, b, -b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are to be found.
                Equating
                the
                coordinates we
                find:
            </p>

            <p>\[\frac{a}{\cosh \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)} = \cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)\]</p>
            <p>\[\frac{b}{\cosh \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)} = \frac{\sqrt{\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 -
                1}}{\sqrt{2}}\]</p>

            <p>
                We also have \(a^2 - 3b^2 = 1\) as the vertices lie on our hyperboloid which we can arrange to get:
            </p>

            <p>\[\frac{1}{a^2} = 1 - 3\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2\]</p>
            <p>\[\frac{1}{a^2} = 1 - 3 \frac {\cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 - 1} {2 \cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5}
                \right)^2}\]</p>
            <p>\[a^2 = \frac{2\cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2}{3 - \cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2}\]</p>
            <p>\[b^2 = \frac{\cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 - 1}{3 - \cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2}\]
            </p>

            <p>
                These can be both evaluated in terms of the golden ratio \(\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2\) (as is the
                case with
                most
                of the honeycombs we are going to come across)
            </p>

            <p> \[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3 - \phi}}{2}\]</p>
            <p> \[\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\phi}{2}\]</p>
            <p> \[\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \sqrt{\frac{\phi^3}{\sqrt{5}}}\]</p>

            <p> Using these we get:</p>

            <p>\[a^2 =\frac{\phi^4}{2}\]</p>
            <p>\[b^2 =\frac{\phi}{2}\]</p>

            <p>
                Using these values we can turn our quadratic form \[w^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 1 \] to:
                \[\frac{\phi^4}{2} w^2 - \frac{\phi}{2} \left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right) = 1\]
                In fact we can write this as:
                \[\phi^3 w^2 - \left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right) = \frac{2}{\phi}\]
                which simplifies calculations later!
            </p>

            <p>
                This makes our lives A LOT easier as instead of dealing with coordinates of the form \( \left(
                \frac{\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{\phi}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{\phi}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{\phi}{2}}
                \right)\) we
                can
                deal with coordinates looking like \((1, 1, 1, 1)\) (at least to begin with)
            </p>

            <p>
                So we've got our quadratic form and the location of our vertices so what we need to do is calculate
                the
                reflection matrices to tesselate \(\mathbb{H}^3\). Since we are dealing with a fundamental
                tetrahedron and
                reflections happen across faces we are looking for 4 matrices. This also makes sense as the Coxeter
                group
                \(\{4,
                3, 5\}\) has 4 generators and we are dealing with \(\mathbb{H}^3\)
            </p>

            <p>
                First things first is to label up the coordinates of our fundamental domain. It turns out that we
                can use
                unscaled coordinates (\(\Phi \neq 1\)) as the reflection formula that we are going to use doesn't
                require
                normalisation.
            </p>

                <li>\(E\) is the midpoint of \((1, 1, 1, 1)\) and \((1, 1, 1, -1)\) so by our midpoint formula \( E

                that
                is perpendicular to the vectors for the face's vertices. (bit of a mouthful)

        <div>
            What's Going On?

            Hopefully by now you'll have played around with a couple of the shapes and
            you're probably wndering what they even are. Short answer is:

            they're honeycombs.

            So why don't they look like the cute little houses that bees make?

            Let's start by seeing what makes a bee's honeycomb a honeycomb:

            [IMAGE]

            The honeycomb that bees make is the gold standard of symmetry. Made up of
            repeating hexagonal chambers all of the same size and shape it's optimised for
            the storing of honey and larvae. So how doe this fit in with the 3d shapes?
            What we need do is to pick the key features of the bee's honeycomb,
            express them in a bit of maths and then see how they generalise. From the image
            above we can extract a couple of things:

            1) It's made up of lots of repeating hexagons
            2) The hexagons are all the same size and shape
            3) The arrangement is neat - there's a lot of symmetry

            We can now decide on which of these ideas we want to take with us and
            generalise!

            Idea 1: Using hexagons is completely fine but also quite restrictive - do other
            shapes work?
            Idea 2: The fact that none of the hexagons is 'special' is quite nice
            (and fair!) - might be a good one to keep
            Idea 3: Symmetry is kinda cool

            So now we can build a question to investigate:

            'What regular polygons tesselate the plane?'

            Breaking this down:

            regular = the shapes we are using all have the same angles and side lengths
            polygons = the shapes have straight sides and don't intersect themselves [IMAGE]
            tesselate = this word will come up quite a lot and is interchangeable with
            honeycomb i.e. if the shape tesselates then it makes a honeycomb (aka a tesselation)
            plane = we will focus our attention on the Euclidean plane first.
            This basically means we can draw the honeycombs on a flat piece of paper
            (if the paper was infinitely big...)

            This question is really quite quick to answer and it turns out that there are only three solutions.

            [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]

            All three of these are rather well known from any maths/science/design notebook.
            Alternatively the triangular tesselation is how you stack toblerones, the square one
            is basically pixel-art, a chessboard, tetris etc... and the hexagon one is the bee's
            honeycomb from earlier.

            So why are there only 3?

            When we make out tesselation we don't want there to be any spaces inbetween the polygons.
            This means that around every point the angles need to add up to 360 (I'll switch to radians later)
            So we need the solutions to:

            360 = k * 180 * (1 - 2 / n)

            2 = k * (1 - 2 / n)

            2n = k (n - 2)

            4 = (k - 2)(n - 2)

            Therefore k - 2 = 4, n - 2 = 1
            or k - 2 = 2, n - 2 = 2
            or k - 2 = 1, n - 2 = 4
            or k - 2 = -4, n - 2 = -1
            or k - 2 = -2, n - 2 = -2
            or k - 2 = -1, n - 2 = -4

            Solving these gives (k, n) = (6, 3), (4, 4), (3, 6), (-2, 1), (0, 0), (1, -2)

            We want positive integer solutions ie (k, n) = (6, 3), (4, 4), (3, 6)

            These three solutions exactly correspond to the three plane tesselations:

            (6, 3) = hexagonal
            (4, 4) = square
            (3, 6) = triangular

            You might notice that these numbers are the same as those HERE, but we will see these again later!

            What about 3d?

            Moving into 3d things get a bit more tricky (predictably) and we need to change our question

            So instead of 'What regular polygons tesselate the plane?' we need ask
            'What regular polytopes tesselate 3d Euclidean Space?

            Breaking this down again:

            regular polytopes = Instead of using triangles/squares/hexagons we are using the 3d versions.
            It turns out that there are only 5 shapes that we can use: tetrahedron,
            cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron. Again regular means that
            all the edge lengths and angles are the same as each other
            3d Euclidean space = This is the usual 3d world we live in with the x, y, z directions.

            How many solutions are there then?

            1....

            Yeah there's only one. It's called the cubic honeycomb and is most commonly seen in Minecraft.

            [IMAGE]

            So is that it?

            Basically yeah! It turns out that the cubic honeycomb exists in higher dimensions which
            I might look at later but other than that we're done.

            Or are we?

            We haven't even talked at the other shapes from the homepage! Before we talk about them we need to know
            a bit about different geometries

            Euclidean Geometry

            So far we've only looked at Euclidean space. This is the world that we are used to in day-to-day life
            and can be characterised by the fact that we can measure distances with Pythagorus' theorem

            A^2 + B^2 = C^2

            This formula only works in 2d but can be easily extended to as many dimensions as we want!

            Suppoose we have two points in Nd space: P_1 = (x1, x2, ..., xn), P_2 = (y1, y2, ..., yn).
            Then the distance between them is given by

            |P_1P_2| = sqrt()

            Once we have a way of measuring distances then we can also work out angles which is done
            through the cosine formula.

            When we give ourselves a way of measuring distances we call it a metric.
            Technically it's the other way around - given a metric we get a way of calculating distances.

            To find the metric we take the our distance function and look at the coefficients:

            ()^2 + ()^2 + ()^2 + ()^2 + ()^2
            |
            |
            (1,0,0,0)

            It also works the other way around too! Knowing the values in the metric allows us to find
            the metric.

            Armed with this information we can now call Nd Euclidean space R^N where R^N stands for
            all the vector (x1, x2, ... xN) where the xi are all real numbers and the method of
            calculating distances uses the metric (1000 0100 0010 0001).

            What happens when we change the metric (method of calculating distances)?

            It turns out that there are two really important geometries that arise from different metrics!

            Spherical Geometry

            This geometry is probably the second most easy to visualise after the Euclidean one.
            Why? Because we live on a sphere! There are also a lot of examples of spheres in our
            world - balls, oranges etc meaning that this geometry is not particularly abstract/hard
            to visualise at least for small dimensions.

            So how do we descibe it mathematically?

            The nD sphere is the set of points that are a distance of 1 from the origin in R^N+1
            It can be described by the equation: x0^2 + ... + xn^2 = 1. The metric tensor is given by
            (1000 ...)
            and the distance phi between two points on the sphere P_1 = (x0, x1, x2, ..., xn),
            P_2 = (y0, y1, y2, ..., yn) is given by:

            cos(phi) = <P_1, P_2> = x0y0 + ..... xnyn

                Hyperbolic Geometry

                On the flip side there is another
