                To generate a regular honeycomb ***LINK*** we need three integer parameters \(p\), \(q\), \(r\) all
                greater than 3.
                Writing these as \(\{p,q,r\}\) gives us the Coxeter symbol for the honeycomb. Each of the three
                parameters specify a particular aspect of the honeycomb:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>\(p\) - number of edges/vertices per face</li>
                <li>\(q\) - number of faces surrounding each vertex</li>
                <li>\(r\) - number of cells surrounding each edge</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                From these three numbers we can determine whether the resulting honeycomb exists in
                \(\mathbb{S}^3\),
                \(\mathbb{E}^3\) or \(\mathbb{H}^3\) by looking at the sign of \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{p}\right)
                \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{r}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{q}\right)\) ****derived here****:
            </p>

            <p>
                $$
                \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{p}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{r}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{q}\right)
                \begin{cases}
                \gt 0, & \mathbb{S}^3\\
                = 0, & \mathbb{E}^3\\
                \lt 0, & \mathbb{H}^3
                \end{cases}
                $$
            </p>

            <p>
                Solving this equation in each case gives the following:

            <p>
                The \(\mathbb{S}^3\) honeycombs are usually called polychorons and are the 4D analogues of the
                platonic solids
                ****link***
            </p>

            <p>
                The \(\mathbb{E}^3\) honeycomb \(\{4,3,4\}\) is more commonly recognised as Minecraft and is a 3-way
                infinite grid of cubes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The \(\mathbb{H}^3\) honbeycombs consist of all the leftover combinations of \(\{p,q,r\}\). Despite
                the fact that they are much more common, they're arguably the most interesting and are of active
                study in Knot theory, Topology and Number theory.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each of the these three groups have very different flavour ***link* mainly due to the fact that the
                underlying spaces have different curvatures:
            </p>

                <tr>
                    <th>Geometry \(M\)</th>
                    <th>Curvature \(K\)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>\(\mathbb{S}^3\)</th>

            <p>
                In order to "see" the \(\mathbb{S}^3\) and \(\mathbb{H}^3\) honeycombs we need to project them to
                \(\mathbb{R}^3\) (i.e. to 3D cartesian coordinates). This is because \(\mathbb{S}^3\) and
                \(\mathbb{H}^3\)
                are 3-manifolds non isometric to \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and so don't naturally embed with in the Euclidean
                metric.
                We don't need to do anything with \(\mathbb{E}^3\) as is is isometric to \(\mathbb{R}^3\)
            </p>

            <p>
                For \(\mathbb{S}^3\) we are going to use the stereographic projection which maps:
            </p>

            <p>
                $$
                (w, x, y, z) \rightarrow \left(\frac{x}{1+w}, \frac{y}{1+w}, \frac{z}{1+w}\right)
                $$
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a fairly standard mapping and more can be found here: ****LINK****
            </p>

            <p>
                For \(\mathbb{H}^3\) we have a choice of a few different projections, each of which have their
                benefits. The resultant image is known as a Model.

                \(\mathbb{S}^3\): There are 6 different honeycombs, 3 made up of tetrahedra, 1 made up of cubes, 1
                made of octahedra and 1 of dodecahedra. More info on these can be found here ****LINK****

                \(\mathbb{H}^3\): There are infinitely many hyperbolic honeycombs and can have a number of different
                characteristics ****LINK****. In the Klein/Poincare model they look like this:

        <div class="text">

            <p>
                This isn't the only way to group the honeycombs. It turns out that they naturally fall into classes
                formed by fixing \(p\), \(q\) in \(\{p,q,r\}\) and varying \(r\). For example this gives the cubic
                honeycomb
                family:
            </p>

            <p>
                $$
                \{4,3,3\}, \{4,3,4\}, \{4,3,5\}, \{4,3,6\}, \{4,3,7\}, \dots
                $$
            </p>

            <p>
                Viewing these together shows how the characteristics of the cell change when going from
                \(\mathbb{S}^3\) to \(\mathbb{E}^3\) to \(\mathbb{H}^3\).

                Spherical ones look rounder, euclidean ones look flat (although they only exist for

                while
                hyperbolic ones look pointy and some even have their corners cut-off - more details here

                Switching to the Upper Half Space model the hyperbolic honeycombs look less symmetrical but their
