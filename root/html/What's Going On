What's Going On?

Hopefully by now you'll have played around with a couple of the shapes and 
you're probably wndering what they even are. Short answer is: 

they're honeycombs.

So why don't they look like the cute little houses that bees make?

Let's start by seeing what makes a bee's honeycomb a honeycomb:

[IMAGE]

The honeycomb that bees make is the gold standard of symmetry. Made up of 
repeating hexagonal chambers all of the same size and shape it's optimised for 
the storing of honey and larvae. So how doe this fit in with the 3d shapes? 
What we need do is to pick the key features of the bee's honeycomb,
express them in a bit of maths and then see how they generalise. From the image
above we can extract a couple of things:

1) It's made up of lots of repeating hexagons
2) The hexagons are all the same size and shape 
3) The arrangement is neat - there's a lot of symmetry

We can now decide on which of these ideas we want to take with us and 
generalise!

Idea 1: Using hexagons is completely fine but also quite restrictive - do other
        shapes work?
Idea 2: The fact that none of the hexagons is 'special' is quite nice 
        (and fair!) - might be a good one to keep
Idea 3: Symmetry is kinda cool

So now we can build a question to investigate:

'What regular polygons tesselate the plane?'

Breaking this down:

regular   = the shapes we are using all have the same angles and side lengths
polygons  = the shapes have straight sides and don't intersect themselves [IMAGE]
tesselate = this word will come up quite a lot and is interchangeable with 
            honeycomb i.e. if the shape tesselates then it makes a honeycomb (aka a tesselation)
plane     = we will focus our attention on the Euclidean plane first. 
            This basically means we can draw the honeycombs on a flat piece of paper 
            (if the paper was infinitely big...)

This question is really quite quick to answer and it turns out that there are only three solutions.

[IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]

All three of these are rather well known from any maths/science/design notebook. 
Alternatively the triangular tesselation is how you stack toblerones, the square one
is basically pixel-art, a chessboard, tetris etc... and the hexagon one is the bee's 
honeycomb from earlier.

So why are there only 3?

When we make out tesselation we don't want there to be any spaces inbetween the polygons.
This means that around every point the angles need to add up to 360 (I'll switch to radians later)
So we need the solutions to:

360 = k * 180 * (1 - 2 / n)

2 = k * (1 - 2 / n)

2n = k (n - 2)

4 = (k - 2)(n - 2)

Therefore k - 2 = 4, n - 2 = 1
       or k - 2 = 2, n - 2 = 2
       or k - 2 = 1, n - 2 = 4
       or k - 2 = -4, n - 2 = -1
       or k - 2 = -2, n - 2 = -2
       or k - 2 = -1, n - 2 = -4

Solving these gives (k, n) = (6, 3), (4, 4), (3, 6), (-2, 1), (0, 0), (1, -2)

We want positive integer solutions ie (k, n) = (6, 3), (4, 4), (3, 6)

These three solutions exactly correspond to the three plane tesselations:

(6, 3) = hexagonal
(4, 4) = square
(3, 6) = triangular

You might notice that these numbers are the same as those HERE, but we will see these again later!

What about 3d?

Moving into 3d things get a bit more tricky (predictably) and we need to change our question

So instead of 'What regular polygons tesselate the plane?' we need ask 
'What regular polytopes tesselate 3d Euclidean Space?

Breaking this down again:

regular polytopes  = Instead of using triangles/squares/hexagons we are using the 3d versions.
                     It turns out that there are only 5 shapes that we can use: tetrahedron, 
                     cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron. Again regular means that 
                     all the edge lengths and angles are the same as each other
3d Euclidean space = This is the usual 3d world we live in with the x, y, z directions.

How many solutions are there then?

1....

Yeah there's only one. It's called the cubic honeycomb and is most commonly seen in Minecraft.

[IMAGE]

So is that it?

Basically yeah! It turns out that the cubic honeycomb exists in higher dimensions which 
I might look at later but other than that we're done.

Or are we?

We haven't even talked at the other shapes from the homepage! Before we talk about them we need to know
a bit about different geometries

Euclidean Geometry

So far we've only looked at Euclidean space. This is the world that we are used to in day-to-day life
and can be characterised by the fact that we can measure distances with Pythagorus' theorem

A^2 + B^2 = C^2

This formula only works in 2d but can be easily extended to as many dimensions as we want!

Suppoose we have two points in Nd space: P_1 = (x1, x2, ..., xn), P_2 = (y1, y2, ..., yn).
Then the distance between them is given by

|P_1P_2| = sqrt()

Once we have a way of measuring distances then we can also work out angles which is done
through the cosine formula.

When we give ourselves a way of measuring distances we call it a metric. 
Technically it's the other way around - given a metric we get a way of calculating distances.

To find the metric we take the our distance function and look at the coefficients:

()^2 + ()^2 + ()^2 + ()^2 + ()^2
|
|
(1,0,0,0)

It also works the other way around too! Knowing the values in the metric allows us to find
the metric.

Armed with this information we can now call Nd Euclidean space R^N where R^N stands for
all the vector (x1, x2, ... xN) where the xi are all real numbers and the method of
calculating distances uses the metric (1000 0100 0010 0001).

What happens when we change the metric (method of calculating distances)?

It turns out that there are two really important geometries that arise from different metrics!

Spherical Geometry

This geometry is probably the second most easy to visualise after the Euclidean one.
Why? Because we live on a sphere! There are also a lot of examples of spheres in our 
world - balls, oranges etc meaning that this geometry is not particularly abstract/hard
to visualise at least for small dimensions.

So how do we descibe it mathematically?

The nD sphere is the set of points that are a distance of 1 from the origin in R^N+1
It can be described by the equation: x0^2 + ... + xn^2 = 1. The metric tensor is given by
(1000 ...)
and the distance phi between two points on the sphere P_1 = (x0, x1, x2, ..., xn), 
P_2 = (y0, y1, y2, ..., yn) is given by:

cos(phi) = <P_1, P_2> = x0y0  + ..... xnyn

Hyperbolic Geometry

On the flip side there is another
