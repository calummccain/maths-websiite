    <h1>How to tesselate \(\mathbb{H}^3\)</h1>

    <p>In order two tesselate \(\mathbb{H}^3\) we need to calculate two things:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>What cell we're tesselating</li>
        <li>How many of them fit around each edge</li>
        <li>The size of the cells</li>
        <li>The reflection matrices corresponding to the tesselation</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Cell size is important because Hyperbolic spaces are fundamentally different to the usual Euclidean space that
        we are used to. Essentially angles and lengths are much more dependent on each other; knowing the angles gives
        you the lengths and knowing the lengths gives you the angles. These relations are encapsulated in the
        hyperbolic trig formulae (link) where you can find more info on why theres a difference.
    </p>

    <p>
        The method we are using to calculate the vertices of our tessellation revolves around the fact that hyperbolic
        tessellation’s (and other tessellation’s in general) have a Coxeter group attached to them (link). These groups
        have ‘nice’ geometric interpretations and their generators (link) can be explicitly calculated in terms of
        matrices. With these matrices, which end up being reflections, we can take one of our cells and reflect it to
        fill up our space.
    </p>

    <p>
        Probably the best way to follow this recipe is to use an example and the arguably simplest one to look at is the
        order 5 cubic honeycomb with the Schläfi symbol \(\left\{4, 3, 5 \right\}\) (link). This is the analogue of the
        usual way that
        you’d pack cubes in a box - a bit like Tetris or boring lego, but instead of having 4 cubes around each edge, we
        have 5. This is where our intuition breaks down a little as it’s quite clear that this isn’t possible not but in
        Hyperbolic space we have more freedom with the angles so we should be ok.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
        The first step is to construct our fundamental tetrahedron (link). We are going to use a cell centred model (the
        tessellation is symmetric about our origin \( \left(1, 0, 0, 0 \right)\) and there is a cell that has the origin
        as it’s centre.
        It’s worth mentioning that we are going to be using the hyperboloid model (link) as it has a nice quadratic form
        - useful for later, and <a href="geodesic.html">geodesics</a> are easier to calculate. We can also use some
        little hacks because we
        are using cubes, such as the coordinates of the vertices, edges and faces are easier to calculate.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to make some progress we need to know some of the angles in the tetrahedron. It turns out that 4 of the
        12 are actually right angles. This can be seen by either the fact that it looks right or more scientifically you
        can use the Coxeter diagram of the group:
    </p>

    <p>
        4---3---5
        V E F C
    </p>

    <p>
        This says that the angles between the V F planes, V C planes and E C planes are all \(\pi/2\); the angle
        between the VE planes is \(\pi/4\); the angle between the EF planes is \(\pi/3\) and the angle between the FC
        planes is
        \(\pi/5\). The best way to represent this is by drawing a net of the tetrahedron. It’s worth mentioning that the
        triangles are hyperbolic and so the angles don’t have to add up to pi.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
        We actually need one more angle however - FCE. We can’t directly read it from the coxeter diagram so we will use
        a bit of geometry. In the Poincare model (link) of hyperbolic space the central cube is going to be a ‘scaled
        down’ version of the usual Euclidean cube. I’ve put scaled in inverted commas as it’s not all scaled down by.
        The same amount but long story short, we can let C prop (0, 0, 0), F prop (1, 0, 0), E prop (1, 1, 0), V prop
        (1, 1, 1). Using the standard euclidean inner product we find FCE is \(\pi/4\).
    </p>

    <p>
        We have now all the angles that we need to calculate the hyperbolic distances between the points of our
        fundamental tetrahedron. Given all the right angles we are going to make use of the hyperbolic right-angled
        triangle formulas (link)
    </p>

    <p>\[\cosh(c) = \cosh(a) \cosh(b) = \cot(A) \cot(B)\]</p>

    <p>
        From this we find:
    </p>

    <p>\[\cosh(CE) = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)cot\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\]</p>

    <p>
        From this we can actually work out the coordinates of E in the hyperboloid model. Remember C(1, 0, 0, 0) and
        cosh(CE) =
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore \(E \left( \cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right), \frac{\sqrt{\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 -
        1}}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{\sqrt{\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 - 1}}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 \right)\)
    </p>

    <p>
        We have that the midpoint of the hyperbolic line between \(A\) and \(B\) is:
    </p>

    <p>\[\frac{A + B}{2\cosh\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)}\]</p>

    <p>
        E is situated between \((a, b, b, b)\) and \((a, b, b, -b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are to be found. Equating the
        coordinates we
        find:
    </p>

    <p>\[\frac{a}{\cosh \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)} = \cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)\]</p>
    <p>\[\frac{b}{\cosh \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)} = \frac{\sqrt{\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 -
        1}}{\sqrt{2}}\]</p>

    <p>
        We also have \(a^2 - 3b^2 = 1\) as the vertices lie on our hyperboloid which we can arrange to get:
    </p>

    <p>\[\frac{1}{a^2} = 1 - 3\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2\]</p>
    <p>\[\frac{1}{a^2} = 1 - 3 \frac {\cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 - 1} {2 \cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5}
        \right)^2}\]</p>
    <p>\[a^2 = \frac{2\cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2}{3 - \cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2}\]</p>
    <p>\[b^2 = \frac{\cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2 - 1}{3 - \cot \left ( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)^2}\]</p>

    <p>
        These can be both evaluated in terms of the golden ratio \(\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2\) (as is the case with most
        of the honeycombs we are going to come across)
    </p>

    <p> \[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3 - \phi}}{2}\]</p>
    <p> \[\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\phi}{2}\]</p>
    <p> \[\cot \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \sqrt{\frac{\phi^3}{\sqrt{5}}}\]</p>

    <p> Using these we get:</p>

    <p>\[a^2 =\frac{\phi^4}{2}\]</p>
    <p>\[b^2 =\frac{\phi}{2}\]</p>

    <p>
        Using these values we can turn our quadratic form \[w^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 1 \] to:
        \[\frac{\phi^4}{2} w^2 - \frac{\phi}{2} \left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right) = 1\]
        In fact we can write this as:
        \[\phi^3 w^2 - \left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right) = \frac{2}{\phi}\]
        which simplifies calculations later!
    </p>

    <p>
        This makes our lives A LOT easier as instead of dealing with coordinates of the form \( \left(
        \frac{\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{\phi}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{\phi}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{\phi}{2}} \right)\) we can
        deal with coordinates looking like \((1, 1, 1, 1)\) (at least to begin with)
    </p>

    <p>
        So we've got our quadratic form and the location of our vertices so what we need to do is calculate the
        reflection matrices to tesselate \(\mathbb{H}^3\). Since we are dealing with a fundamental tetrahedron and
        reflections happen across faces we are looking for 4 matrices. This also makes sense as the Coxeter group \(\{4,
        3, 5\}\) has 4 generators and we are dealing with \(\mathbb{H}^3\)
    </p>

    <p>
        First things first is to label up the coordinates of our fundamental domain. It turns out that we can use
        unscaled coordinates (\(\Phi \neq 1\)) as the reflection formula that we are going to use doesn't require
        normalisation.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>\(V(1, 1, 1, 1)\)</li>
        <li>\(E\) is the midpoint of \((1, 1, 1, 1)\) and \((1, 1, 1, -1)\) so by our midpoint formula \( E \propto (1,
            1, 1, 0)\)</li>
        <li>\(F\) is the midpoint of \((1, 1, 1, 0)\) and \((1, 1, 0, 1)\) so by our midpoint formula \( F \propto (1,
            1, 0, 0)\)</li>
        <li>\(C(1, 0, 0, 0)\)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Let's find some normals to use in the reflection formula (link). For each face we need to find the vector that
        is perpendicular to the vectors for the face's vertices. (bit of a mouthful)
